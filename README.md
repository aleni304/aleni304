- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @aleni304!
- ðŸŽ“ Iâ€™m a Systems Engineering student who is familiar with Java and C++ languages, and who is always trying to learn many more because I enjoy coding and showing my progress on personal projects.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and C# languages, so you'll see me posting the knowledge I gain from them.
- ðŸŽ® When I'm not coding, you'll see me playing some video games or drawing (my second passion) while listening to music.
- ðŸŽˆ Feel free to take a look at my projects!
